I removed an extra _ to match the naming convention of everything else for the following to registers:
#define TMC5072_V1_MASK                  0x0FFFFF // V1_M1 // First acceleration / deceleration phase threshold velocity (unsigned) 0: Disables A1 and D1 phase, use AMAX, DMAX only // EDITED BY JOSHUA-8
#define TMC5072_V1_SHIFT                 0 // min.: 0, max.: 1048575, default: 0 // EDITED BY JOSHUA-8
